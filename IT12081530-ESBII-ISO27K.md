#Objective


#######This report provides the business case scenario of an ISO 27001 information security management system implemented by a consultant in order to maintain the client’s requirements.

##ISO 27001 Business case study

The client in this is an IT firm specialist in Union bank. In order to access new business opportunities by improving their ability to demonstrate adherence to best practice, the client chose to implement an ISO 27001-compliant information security management system. The aim of this was to enable the client to assure clients and other interested parties that their data would be handled securely.
With the help of consultant, this client found implementation of ISO 27001 to be straightforward. The client’s pre-existing expertise in the field of information technology meant that it had a high level of awareness of information security issues. A gap analysis carried out by consultant revealed that the client already had many processes and procedures in place that satisfied many of the requirements of the standard. Consultant added value by bringing greater coherence and consistency to the client’s internal practices, by implementing the structured framework stipulated by ISO 27001.

###Business benefits and cost of ISO27k
The consultant said “ISO27k is not just about information security or IT; it actually helps the organization save and make money”. She identified the following direct and indirect business benefits of ISO27k for Union bank.

#####Direct benefits

##Information security risk reduction: 
Comprehensive, well-structured approach increases the likelihood that all relevant information security threats, vulnerabilities and impacts will be identified, assessed and treated rationally.

##Increased reliability and security of systems: 
ISO27k has ensured that they now have controls in place that maintain system availability and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited. Post-certification ‘surveillance visits’ and re-certification audits against ISO27k ensure the business keep up-to-date with the latest vulnerabilities and best practices.

##Increased profits:  
ISO27k certificate demonstrates that they can be trusted to secure their customers’ data, as well as company data.  Customers not only understand that investment in ISO27k has given them benefits, but also they are prepared to spend a little more for a secured IT infrastructure. Since gaining ISO27k marked increase in bottom line profit, some new customers are telling they prefer to trade with companies who have a recognized security certification. Additionally, employees are wasting less time surfing the Internet for sites not related to work.

##Cost-effective and consistent information security: 
ISO27k have implemented cost-effective security matched to business needs. Union bank had many technical safeguards throughout the organization, but the risk assessment highlighted that some of ISO27k safeguards offered little or no business benefit and would provide a better return off investment if they were reconfigured to protect assets that required a higher level of protection. All divisions and departments within Union bank had previously developed their own security guidelines. ISO27k helped us to develop a consistent approach to security by creating uniform policies incorporating industry best practice. Where necessary, employee compliance with the policies is supported by an enforceable disciplinary process.

##Compliance with legislation:
Implementing ISO27k forced us to comply with UK legislation in areas such as data protection and software copyright.

#####Indirect benefits

##Improved management control: 
Managers have more control over the organization, and better quality information with which to manage it - management effort is therefore reduced.

##Enhanced customer and trading partner confidence: 
With the heightened sensitivity to security breaches, trading partners, customers and vendors were looking for the evidence of security. ISO27k certification has provided this assurance. In any industry you have to stand out from your competitors. Having the ISO27k logos on company literature is a continual reminder to potential and existing customers that they are a professionally-run organization who takes the confidentially, integrity and availability of their and our information seriously.

#####Cost saving

* Increases ability to transfer certain risks selectively to insurers or other third parties, and may facilitate negotiating reduced insurance premiums as key controls are implemented and managed
* After standardization with ISO27k, it provides a security baseline i.e. a solid platform of basic, almost universally required information security controls on which to implement specific additional controls as appropriate.
* Avoids having to specify the same basic controls repeatedly in every situation.
* Is generally applicable and hence re-usable across multiple departments, functions, business units and organizations without significant changes. 
* 	Allows the organization to concentrate effort and resources on specific additional security requirements necessary to protect particular information assets.

##### Brand Value

* Based on globally recognized and well respected security standards.
* ISO27k standards suite is being actively developed and maintained by the standards bodies, reflecting new security challenges (such as BYOD and cloud computing)

#####ISO27k costs

* The costs of implementing ISO27k are very modest. The main cost element was the pain of cultural change (we had to ‘let a couple of our people go’ for not complying with policies and procedures). The regular compliance reviews to maintain our certification only costs us about £3k [US$5k] a year, so ISO27k is very cost-effective.
